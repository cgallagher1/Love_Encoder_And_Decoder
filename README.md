# Love_Encoder_And_Decoder
The encoder uses Matrix Multiplication on top of an addition alogorithm that targters the top ten most used letters in love letters/ movies.
The Deconder then uses the key matrix that was used to multiply the orignal letter in order to devide the matrix back to the orignal ascii numbers.The decoder then uses the passed in special number that was genterated in the encodered to add to the sepecial letters to substract to the special letter now to get them back to their orignal ascii values.
